<h1> Wrangling Report </h1>

<h2> Data Gathering </h2>

From three different sources:

<ol>
  
  <li> <h4> The WeRateDogs Twitter archive : </h4> 
    
    The WeRateDogs Twitter archive provided by Udacity. This contains basic tweet data for all 5000+ of their tweets, but not everything.I manually downloaded this file manually by clicking the following link: twitter_archive_enhanced.csv </li>
  
  <li> <h4>The tweet image predictions :</h4>  what breed of dog (or other object, animal, etc.) is present in each tweet according to a neural network. This file (image_predictions.tsv) is hosted on Udacity's servers and should be downloaded programmatically using the Requests library and the following URL: image_predictions.tsv  
  </li>
  
  <li> 
    <h4> Data via the Twitter API </h4> : Querying the twitter API using Tweepy library to get basic data such as retweet count, favorite count, etc.
    
  </li>
